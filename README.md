# Portfolio Database Manager
This is a Database Management system for the database in the [portfolio website](https://github.com/Sean-Grobicki/Projects-Website). This provides a UI to easily make changes to the database which is in MongoDB. The content in the database consists of portfolio projects to showcase for employers. This program is unavailable for demo but can be viewed in a video demo linked [here](www.youtube.com).
